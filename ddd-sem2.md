# Effective Data Driven Decision Science:
The Effective Data Driven Decision Science program is designed to equip students with the skills necessary to leverage data and analytics in decision making. Through this program, students will develop a deep understanding of data collection, analysis, and visualization techniques, as well as an understanding of how to develop compelling data narratives that drive effective decision making.

## Unit 1: Foundations of Data Driven Decision Science
- Introduction to data-driven decision making and the role of data in decision making
- Key concepts and terminology in data science, including descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
- Overview of the data science process and how it can be applied to decision making
- BUS framework for analytics story framing. 

## Unit 2: Data Collection, Cleaning, and Preprocessing
- Techniques for collecting and cleaning data to ensure accuracy and completeness
- Data preprocessing techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction
- Exploratory data analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends in data

## Unit 3: Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning
- Techniques for developing predictive models using machine learning algorithms
- Supervised learning techniques such as regression and classification
- Unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering and anomaly detection

## Unit 4: Prescriptive Analytics and Decision Support
- Overview of prescriptive analytics and its role in decision making
- Techniques for developing prescriptive models using optimization and simulation techniques
- Overview of decision support systems and how they can be used to facilitate decision making

## Unit 5: Implementation and Communication of Data Driven Decisions
- Techniques for implementing data-driven decisions in organizations
- Effective communication strategies for presenting data and insights to decision makers
- Ethical considerations in data-driven decision making and the importance of data privacy and security

## Possible Assignments
- Exploratory Data Analysis: In this assignment, students will analyze a large dataset and identify patterns and trends that could inform decision making. Students will use techniques such as data cleaning, data normalization, and feature scaling to prepare the data for analysis before creating visualizations that effectively communicate their findings.

- Predictive Modeling: In this assignment, students will develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. Students will use techniques such as regression and classification to create a model that accurately predicts a given outcome. Students will then evaluate the model's effectiveness and explore ways to improve its accuracy.

- Data Storytelling: In this assignment, students will create a data narrative that effectively communicates insights to decision makers. Students will use data visualization techniques and storytelling principles to create a narrative that is compelling, clear, and effective. Students will present their data narrative in class and receive feedback from their peers.

- Decision Support System: In this assignment, students will develop a decision support system using optimization techniques. Students will use optimization and simulation techniques to identify the best course of action in a given scenario. Students will then present their decision support system to the class and explain how it could be used to drive effective decision making.

- Ethical Considerations in Data Science: In this assignment, students will explore the ethical considerations that arise in data-driven decision making. Students will examine issues such as data privacy and security, bias in data analysis, and the responsibility of decision makers to act on data insights. Students will write a reflective essay on their findings and present their conclusions to the class.

## Conclusion
The Effective Data Driven Decision Science program provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles of data-driven decision making. Through a combination of theoretical coursework and hands-on projects, students will develop the skills necessary to analyze, visualize, and communicate data effectively.

As data becomes increasingly important in decision making across industries, this program provides an opportunity for professionals to develop the skills necessary to succeed in a data-driven world. Whether you are looking to advance your career in data science or simply want to gain a deeper understanding of the power of data, this program is an excellent choice.

These units will help decision makers develop the necessary skills to leverage data-driven decision making techniques in their organizations and enable them to make more informed and effective decisions.
