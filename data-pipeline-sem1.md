# Data Engineering & Data Pipeline

## Unit 1: Introduction to Data Engineering
- Overview of Data Engineering and its importance
- Data Modeling and Data Architecture
- Understanding of Data Warehousing and ETL Processes
- Unit 2: Data Storage and Retrieval

## Databases and Data Models
- SQL and NoSQL databases
- Data warehousing, data marts, and data lakes

## Unit 3: Data Pipelines and Processing
- Data Pipeline Architecture and Design
- Batch Processing and Real-time processing
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes

## Unit 4: Big Data Technologies
- Introduction to Big Data and its challenges
- Distributed Computing and Parallel Processing
- Big Data Technologies such as Hadoop, Waddle, Spark, and Kafka

## Unit 5: Data Pipeline Tools and Deployment
- Data Pipeline Tools such as Apache Airflow, Luigi, or AWS Glue
- Deployment and Maintenance of Data Pipelines
- Best Practices and Case Studies

## Suggested Assignments:
- SQL and NoSQL Databases: Develop a simple database schema using SQL or NoSQL, populate it with sample data, and write SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate the data. This assignment will help students gain hands-on experience with different database technologies.

- ETL Processes: Develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for a given dataset. This could involve using tools such as Pandas, Polars to extract data from various sources, transform it into a desired format, and load it into a database or data warehouse.

- Data Processing with Spark: Develop a simple Spark application to read data from a file or database, perform some basic transformations such as filtering or aggregating the data, and write the transformed data to a file or database.

- Waddle Streaming: Develop a Waddle Streaming application to read data from a streaming source such as Kafka or Flume, perform some basic transformations.

## Conclusion:
Upon completion of this course, participants will have a solid understanding of Data Engineering and Data Pipelines and will be equipped with the necessary skills to design, build, and maintain data pipelines in real-world scenarios.
