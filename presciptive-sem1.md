## Suggested Capstone Assignments
- Supply Chain Optimization: Develop an optimization model for a real-world supply chain problem. This could include optimizing transportation routes, inventory levels, and production schedules to minimize costs and improve efficiency.

- Portfolio Optimization: Use portfolio optimization techniques to develop an investment strategy that maximizes returns while minimizing risk. This could involve analyzing historical financial data and using mathematical modeling to make predictions about future market trends.

- Healthcare Resource Allocation: Develop a decision analysis model to help healthcare providers allocate resources (e.g., hospital beds, staff, medical equipment) in the most effective way possible. This could involve considering factors such as patient acuity levels, staffing levels, and budget constraints.

- Production Planning and Scheduling: Develop an optimization model for a manufacturing company to improve production planning and scheduling. This could involve analyzing production data to identify bottlenecks, optimizing production sequences to minimize downtime, and developing an inventory management strategy.

- Risk Analysis for Project Management: Develop a risk analysis model to help project managers identify and mitigate potential risks in complex projects. This could involve using simulation techniques to analyze different scenarios and predict potential outcomes based on different risk factors.

- Transportation Network Optimization: Develop an optimization model for a transportation network (e.g., public transit system, freight logistics network) to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This could involve considering factors such as travel times, vehicle capacities, and route optimization.

- Sales Forecasting: Use time series analysis techniques to develop a sales forecasting model for a retail company. This could involve analyzing historical sales data, identifying trends and patterns, and developing a forecasting model that can be used to predict future sales.




## Conclusion:
Upon completion of this course, participants will have a solid understanding of Prescriptive and Operational Models and will be equipped with the necessary skills to apply these techniques to solve real-world problems. Additionally, this course provides a strong foundation for those who wish to further their studies in data science and related fields.
